✨ Features

✅ AI-Powered Query Input

    Users can type natural language queries in a text input field.
    
    The system provides AI-powered suggestions to help users formulate queries.

✅ Query History Tracking

    Previously submitted queries are stored and displayed, allowing users to reuse or modify them easily.
    
    Clicking on a previous query auto-fills the input field.

✅ Mock Data Visualization

    Query results are displayed visually using charts powered by Recharts/Chart.js.
    
    Example charts include bar graphs, line charts, and pie charts.

✅ State Management with Redux

    The application manages state efficiently using Redux.
    
    Query input, results, and history are all handled through a centralized store.

✅ Responsive and Modern UI

    The UI is designed with Tailwind CSS / Material-UI for a clean and modern look.
    
    Fully responsive design ensures smooth usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
